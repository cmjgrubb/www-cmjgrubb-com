It has given me a lot of opportunties, and I\'ve had the pleasure of working with some amazing people along the way. Great people have given me cool opportunties.</p><p class="post">While I appreciate all the opportunties I\'ve had, my career has happened without much direction on my part. That\'s really due to not knowing what I wanted to do in IT.</p><p class="post">I have finally figured it out, though. I want to be a developer. To become a developer, though, I need projects. So I figured I\'d start a blog about my journey from operations to development.</p><p class="post">This website is my learning platform, and I look forward to sharing my journey with you. I\'ll share my thoughts, struggles, and dreams, and maybe we\'ll find some things we have in common. I hope you enjoy.</p><p class="post">Keep coding and God bless!</p>'
