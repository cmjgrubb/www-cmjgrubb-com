I know the colors I've chosen are a little off.</p><p class=\"post\">But you know what? That's alright.</p><p class=\"post\">I'm still learning, and building this website is meant to help me learn. I want to put together the best website I can, but that doesn't mean I'm going to build the greatest site the world has ever seen overnight.</p><p class=\"post\">Don't be afraid to put yourself out there if it helps you grow. Don't be untrue to yourself. Don't put yourself out there as the grand master of coding because you know how to write links in HTML. There's no shame in learning. There's no shame in being earlier in the path than someone else.</p>"
